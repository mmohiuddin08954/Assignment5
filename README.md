# Assignment5
This project demonstrates the implementation and empirical analysis of both deterministic and randomized versions of the Quicksort algorithm in Python. The code compares the performance of these algorithms on different types of arrays: random, sorted, and reverse-sorted, measuring execution time for each.
# Requirements
To run the code, you need to have Python installed on your system. You will also need the following libraries:

time (built-in)
random (built-in)
pandas
